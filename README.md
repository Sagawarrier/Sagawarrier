- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sagawarrier
- 👀 I’m interested in Rust, C++ and generally, writing code that runs as efficiently and as quickly as possible.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust
- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate on anything particular right now, but I am not against it.
- 📫 How to reach me, I don't know, my discord? Even#4849
